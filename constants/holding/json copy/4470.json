  "description": "In the year 7077, thousands of years after the glacial basin collapsed, evolution looms into a new era where hybrid species dominated the face of the Earth. Alpha Zero was appointed as the supreme authority and has absolute power over the land.As the droids rise into a position of political strength, their insatiable thirst and greed to wield even greater power forced the cyborgs to turn against the confederation.Jin, a cyborg from the forsaken clan of Yurei, leads the revolt against the ruling class.",
